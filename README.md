# athenaeum-hackfs
A decentralized incentive-based platform where individuals can share data from smart devices or genomic data. A compute layer processes and obfuscates the data, making it accessible to researchers in a privacy-preserving manner. Researchers perform computations on the obfuscated data, creating reusable modules. Data providers and module creators are incentivized. The researchers can also issue bounties for computing data. They can verify if the computations have been done or not using zk proof, for which they will also be incentivized if is found helpful by some other researchers. Data providers and module creators are also notified if their contributions were used in the type of research to help them stay more connected to science.
